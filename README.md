# Master Hibernate and JPA with Spring Boot in 100 Steps

## Tutorial from in28Minutes (Udemy)

#####  N plus One Problem

[N+1 query problem with JPA and Hibernate](https://vladmihalcea.com/n-plus-1-query-problem/)

Unlike the default fetch plan, which you are using when calling the find method of the EntityManager, 
a JPQL or Criteria API query defines an explicit plan that Hibernate cannot change by injecting a JOIN FETCH automatically. 
So, you need to do it manually.

-  `JOIN FETCH` rules

#####  92. Step 38 - ManyToMany Mapping - Insert Data and Write Join Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM COURSE, STUDENT_COURSE, STUDENT WHERE COURSE_ID = COURSE.ID AND STUDENT_ID = STUDENT.ID;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM COURSE JOIN STUDENT_COURSE JOIN STUDENT ON COURSE_ID = COURSE.ID AND STUDENT_ID = STUDENT.ID;
```

#####  Generate SQL from Metadata

#####  Delete ManyToMany Association

[Hibernate Tip: Best way to remove entities from a many-to-many association](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYNdjtf7iAQ&feature=emb_logo)

1.  Use a Set instead of a List
2.  Don't Use CascadeType.REMOVE
3.  Provide utility method for bidirectional associations
4.  Cleanup association when removing a referencing entity

#####  99. Step 45 - JPA Inheritance Hierarchies and Mappings - Single Table  

Disadvantages:
-  TOO many nullable columns
-  this can lead to possible errors
-  additional column DTYPE (or choose name by `DiscriminatorColumn`) - data type (`FullTimeEmployee` or `PartTimeEmployee`)

Advantages:
-  it is a single table
-  so queries are simpler

#####  100. Step 46 - JPA Inheritance Hierarchies and Mappings - Table Per Class

Advantages:
-  tables are separate
-  may have many different non-null fields

Disadvantages:
-  many columns are **repeated** (id, name, ...)
-  more complex queries
-  if we want to query all the Employees (parent) got **COMPLEX** query:

Hibernate: 
```sql
select
    employee0_.id as id1_1_,
    employee0_.name as name2_1_,
    employee0_.salary as salary1_2_,
    employee0_.hourly_wage as hourly_w1_3_,
    employee0_.clazz_ as clazz_ 
from
    ( select
        id,
        name,
        salary,
        null as hourly_wage,
        1 as clazz_ 
    from
        full_time_employee 
    union
    all select
        id,
        name,
        null as salary,
        hourly_wage,
        2 as clazz_ 
    from
        part_time_employee 
) employee0_
```

-  if we want to query all the PartTimeEmployees (child) got **SIMPLE** query:

```sql
select
    parttimeem0_.id as id1_1_,
    parttimeem0_.name as name2_1_,
    parttimeem0_.hourly_wage as hourly_w1_3_ 
from
       part_time_employee parttimeem0_
```

#####  101. Step 47 - JPA Inheritance Hierarchies and Mappings - Joined

Advantages
-  minimum total number of columns
-  duplications - only id

Disadvantages
-  more complex queries
-  insert in child query has 2 sub inserts
-  select with join
-  select from 1 table:

```sql
select
    parttimeem0_.id as id1_1_,
    parttimeem0_1_.name as name2_1_,
    parttimeem0_.hourly_wage as hourly_w1_3_ 
from
    part_time_employee parttimeem0_ 
inner join
    employee parttimeem0_1_ 
        on parttimeem0_.id=parttimeem0_1_.id
```
-  select all

```sql
select
    employee0_.id as id1_1_,
    employee0_.name as name2_1_,
    employee0_1_.salary as salary1_2_,
    employee0_2_.hourly_wage as hourly_w1_3_,
    case 
        when employee0_1_.id is not null then 1 
        when employee0_2_.id is not null then 2 
        when employee0_.id is not null then 0 
    end as clazz_ 
from
    employee employee0_ 
left outer join
    full_time_employee employee0_1_ 
        on employee0_.id=employee0_1_.id 
left outer join
    part_time_employee employee0_2_ 
        on employee0_.id=employee0_2_.id
```

####  Section 10: Queries with Entities using JPQL

#####  104. Step 50 - JPQL - Courses without Students

Native SQL Solution 
```sql
SELECT * FROM COURSE 
WHERE ID NOT IN
(SELECT DISTINCT COURSE_ID FROM STUDENT_COURSE );
```
Hibernate solution
```jpaql
select c from Course c where c.students is empty
```
Results in SQL
```sql
select
    course0_.id as id1_0_,
    course0_.created_date as created_2_0_,
    course0_.last_updated_date as last_upd3_0_,
    course0_.name as name4_0_ 
from
    course course0_ 
where
    not (exists (select
        student2_.id 
    from
        student_course students1_,
        student student2_ 
    where
        course0_.id=students1_.course_id 
        and students1_.student_id=student2_.id))
```

#####  107. Step 53 - JPQL - Using Joins

Cross join
```jpaql
select c, s from Course c, Student s
```
will generate
```sql
select
    course0_.id as id1_0_0_,
    student1_.id as id1_5_1_,
    course0_.created_date as created_2_0_0_,
    course0_.last_updated_date as last_upd3_0_0_,
    course0_.name as name4_0_0_,
    student1_.name as name2_5_1_,
    student1_.passport_id as passport3_5_1_ 
from
    course course0_ cross 
join
    student student1_
```

#####  Create complex query with Join 

```jpaql
select distinct c from Course c join c.students s where s.passport.number like '%1234%'
```

```sql
select
    distinct course0_.id as id1_0_,
    course0_.created_date as created_2_0_,
    course0_.last_updated_date as last_upd3_0_,
    course0_.name as name4_0_ 
from
    course course0_ 
inner join
    student_course students1_ 
        on course0_.id=students1_.course_id 
inner join
    student student2_ 
        on students1_.student_id=student2_.id cross 
join
    passport passport3_ 
where
    student2_.passport_id=passport3_.id 
    and (
        passport3_.number like '%1234%'
    )
```

####  Section 14: Caching with Hibernate & JPA

#####  128. Step 74 - Hibernate and JPA Caching - Second Level Cache`

-  Session Metrics of Level 2 Cache (L2C)
    -  first request `/api/courses/10001`
        -  `3777200 nanoseconds spent performing 1 L2C puts;`
        -  `0 nanoseconds spent performing 0 L2C hits;`
        -  `1783700 nanoseconds spent performing 1 L2C misses;`
    -  second request `/api/courses/10001`
        -  `0 nanoseconds spent performing 0 L2C puts;`
        -  `285500 nanoseconds spent performing 1 L2C hits;`
        -  `0 nanoseconds spent performing 0 L2C misses;`

####  Section 15: Hibernate & JPA Tips

#####  130. Step 76 - Hibernate Soft Deletes - Part 2

`@Where(clause = "is_deleted = false")` is not added to Native Queries automatically. We must add it manually if we want to use Soft Delete.

#####  131. Step 77 - JPA Entity Life Cycle Methods

In `javax.persistence.*` we have method annotations
-  `PostLoad`
-  `PostPersist`
-  `PostRemove`
-  `PostUpdate`
-  `PrePersist`
-  `PreRemove`
-  `PreUpdate`
